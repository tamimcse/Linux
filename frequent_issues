Problem: If Gstreamer video does not work, check if you are getting error in Gstreamer application. If Gstreamer application does not give any error, and the bbb.mp4 wouldnot be played by the player, most probably qtdemux has not been installed properly. It is part of gstreamer-plugins-good. But it may happen that gstreamer-plugins-good is installed, still that element is not present.

Solution: Uninstall and reinstall Gstreamer-plugins-good from source.


Problem: If eBPF wouldnot compile.

Solution: Please look at the README at samples/bpf/. Most probably you need to also execute make headers_install to make it to work. eBPF also requires to enable many kernel options. Make sure all of them are enabled.


Problem: Sometime you cannot log into Linux after modifing kernel.

Solution: Shut down and restart by power button. Chances are it will show you an option to boot into a previous kernel. If it does not, press F9 to select boot option. Then select ....."EFI" and "Ubuntu" and then "GRUB" and you will be presented with an option to boot into an old kernel. This process however take many times. Better solution is to presess F6+F7 continuously during boot. It will show you an option to boot into a previous kernel. 

Problem: Linux crashes while restarting. It is almost impossible to know why. Becouse it shuts down properly and runs into OOPS while restarting.

Solution: Check that you are access some memory (dynamic memory or some NULL poiner) which you shouldn't do. Insted of crashing right then, it ctrashes while restarting.

Problem: eBPF program compiles, but cannot be loaded.
Solution: If you access array, you must check if array index limit.

Problem: If eBPF program is too big, it cannot be loaded.
Solution: Increase the memlock limit ( https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/12/16/best-known-methods-for-setting-locked-memory-size )
